# Installation
There are two basic ways to install Molecular Blender, depending on whether you
want to use the optional cython enhanced isosurface routines (highly recommended,
if you're drawing isosurfaces at all).

## Using setup.py (cython compatible)
The most robust way to install is to use the included `setup.py`:

    cd /path/to/molecular/blender/repo
    echo '{ "Copy Target" : "/path/to/blender/scripts/addons" }' > conf.json
    python3 setup.py build --copy

For this to work, you'll need to use python 3.7 (the same version used in Blender 2.80),
and have cython installed for it.

## Symlink (no cython)
If you are okay with skipping cython, you can directly symlink from the python
package to the blender scripts directory. The non-cython version has all the same
functionality as the cython version, but may be significantly slower for certain
tasks (cython version is roughly 100 times faster at drawing orbitals from molden
files).

    ln -s /path/to/molecular/blender/repo/molecular_blender /path/to/blender/scripts/addons/

and then it should appear in the list of Import-Export addons that can be
activated like any other addon.

## User supplied addon path
On Mac OS X, the path for a user supplied addon is

    /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Blender/<version>/scripts/addons

where `<username>` and `<version>` should be replaced with your username and the
Blender version you are using.
